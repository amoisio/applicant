# Applicant


## TODO in 1.0
Do squash commit.

Implement base functionality
- Questionnaire filling, completing and styling
- Archive page and ability to view old questionnaires

## TODO after 1.0
- Occasionally the textare control fails to grow and show a scroll bar instead (not nice). As a fix consider replacing textarea control with an editable span.
- Additionally, consider adopting a library which renders span as markdown. Also apply this to the questionnaire page. ++readonly bits would look nicer. 
- Install Wave and make accessibility changes
- Install other accessibility tools and make recommended changes
- Rework styles in css files into scss files.
- Build a simplistic router component and use that on the main page.
